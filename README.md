# Project-Net-i-
NETi is a real-time network visualization tool that scans local networks and captures live packets. It identifies devices, monitors protocols like HTTP, DNS, TCP, and UDP, and streams packet data via WebSockets to a frontend, helping users analyze traffic, detect sensitive data, and understand network activity interactively.
